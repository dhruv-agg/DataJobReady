Using real-world data sets for practice offers several benefits. Firstly, it provides a more authentic learning experience by simulating the challenges and complexities of working with actual data. Secondly, it allows individuals to develop practical skills and gain hands-on experience in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Real-world data sets also expose learners to the diversity and variability present in actual data, preparing them for real-world scenarios. Additionally, practicing with real data enhances problem-solving abilities and fosters critical thinking by requiring individuals to make decisions based on real-world insights and patterns.
